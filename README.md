ABC
====================

Purpose
--------------------

Based on the "JavaScript Drum Kit" exercise from the [JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/) created by Wes Bos, this app helps children learn their ABC's.

By clicking one of the letters displayed on screen, or by pressing the key matching a letter, said letter is sung - melody is a cover of [Patti Labelle's ABC's from Sesame Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0hYxuDav0g).
